Self-Meter
==========

:Status: beta
:Documentation: https://docs.rs/self-meter/

This is a fork of the `self-meter` crate, I hope to add more features, streamline and update the code, as well as add Windows support.

A tiny library to measure resource usage of the process it's used in.
Currently it measures:

* Memory Usage
* CPU Usage with breakdown by each thread
* Disk Usage

More metrics might be added later. Currently, library supports only linux,
but pull requests for other platforms are welcome.
